I'm a reverse-engineering fanatic; creating cheats in games, cracking the web with bots, and building websites just for fun â€” all at the same time. A little crazy, but the code always runs smoothly.

I work alone, no team, no connections. I write cheats for Fivem, tear anti-cheats apart, and overcome every obstacle. I break systems, mess with games â€” everything runs flawlessly.
